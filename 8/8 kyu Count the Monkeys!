You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

==========


function monkeyCount(n) {
return Array.from({length: n}, (x, y) => y + 1)

}
======
{length: n} defines the length
==========
(x, y) => y + 1) (map function)
can be written as
(_,y) => y + 1 since x isnt being used. 

y + 1 means index + 1 which allows us to start the array from 1, going up by 1 each time.



============
another option is using a for loop that creates an array and pushes within the loop parameters

function monkeyCount(n) {
  for (var i = 0, arr = []; i < n; arr.push(++i));
  
  return arr;
}
