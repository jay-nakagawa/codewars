function remove(s,n){
for(let i = 0; i<n; i++){
  s = s.replace('!', '')
}  
  return s
}

*loop until n and replace() every iteration
*replace will act on the first occurence of the matching pattern
*replace('!',") to remove ! was not obvious to me.


function remove(s,n){
  return n>0 ? remove(s.replace('!', ''), n-1) : s;
}

*an alternate solution that uses recursion and deincrements n
