function position(letter){
return `Position of alphabet: ${letter.charCodeAt() - 96}`
}


// goal is to take a letter and return the letters place in the alphabet as a number value
// ie. a = 1 , b = 2.

//charCodeAt() gives us the utf-16 number associated with whatever value is passed in
// if you look at a utf chart you can see that the numbers associated with the alphabet start at 97...... so 97 = a , 98 - b
// if we subtract 96 from charCodeAt it will give us the values we are looking for.
